# MAGIC # Question Answering over Custom Datasets with ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain and MPT-7b-Instruct from MosaicML on Hugging Face ü§ó 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Large Language Models produce some amazing results, chatting and answering questions with seeming intelligence. But how can you get LLMs to answer questions about _your_ specific datasets? Imagine answering questions based on your company's knowledge base, docs or Slack chats. The good news is that this is easy with open-source tooling and LLMs. This example shows how to apply [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html), Hugging Face `transformers`, and an open source LLM from MosaicML called [MPT-7b-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b-instruct). This example can make use of any text-generation LLM or even OpenAI with minor changes. In this case, the data set is a set of freely available published papers in PDF format about cystic fibrosis from PubMed, but could be any corpus of text.

# MAGIC ## Cluster Setup
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Run this on a cluster with Databricks Runtime 13.0 ML GPU. It should work on 12.2 ML GPU as well.
# MAGIC - To run this notebook's examples _without_ distributed Spark inference, all that is needed is a single-node 'cluster', with a single A10 GPU (ex: `g5.4xlarge` on AWS). A100 instances work as well.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We have provided code to create a sample cluster for this notebook. See the `./RUNME` notebook for instructions on how to use this automation.
